# TargetFinder Toolkit

This toolkit accompanies the work presented in the article **TargetFinder: Detecting Widgets from Pixels on Desktop Interfaces**.  
It provides a real-time detection system using the YOLO26 model to predict the bounding boxes of GUI widgets from desktop screenshots — **without requiring access to application internals or accessibility APIs**.

The system is lightweight and easy to integrate, enabling the implementation of advanced interaction techniques.  
As proof of concept, we include two interaction techniques built on top of TargetFinder:

- **[Bubble Cursor](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1054972.1055012)** 
- **[Semantic Pointing](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/985692.985758)** 

> **Compatibility Note**  
> TargetFinder uses the `mss` library for fast screen capture, and the detection engine is theoretically cross-platform. However, the system has been **validated on Windows 10/11 and Linux (Ubuntu X11), and macOS (tested on Apple Silicon in beta)**. 
> Other Linux setups (e.g., distributions other than Ubuntu, or Wayland instead of X11) may also require adjustments.

## Installation

```bash
pip install target-finder-toolkit
```

Or after cloning the repository:
```bash
pip install .
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Linux prerequisites (click to expand)</strong></summary>

During installation on Linux, you may need to install some system packages to avoid common errors:

1. **evdev build tools**  
   If installation fails due to missing `evdev` headers:  
   ```bash
   sudo apt install build-essential python3-dev
   ```

2. **X11 vs Wayland screen capture**  
   `mss` relies on X11 (does not work with Wayland since `XGetImage` is not available).  
   If you see the following error:  
   ```
   mss.exception.ScreenShotError: XGetImage() failed
   ```
   Switch to an X11 session at login.

3. **Qt X11 plugin (`xcb`)**  
   If you encounter errors like:  
   ```
   qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" ...
   ```
   Install the required libraries:  
   ```bash
   sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0 libxkbcommon-x11-0 libxcb-xinerama0
   ```

4. **tk (MouseInfo) support**  
   `pyautogui` or `pynput` may fail if `tk` is missing:  
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-tk python3-dev
   ```

### Python API & Examples

Minimal examples:

#### Print detection changes (callback)

```python
import time
from target_finder_toolkit.targetfinder import TargetFinder
from target_finder_toolkit import postprocess as pp

def on_change(detections, added, removed, frame):
    """
    Called every time the detector refreshes.
    - detections: [{id, x, y, width, height, score, class_id, class_name} ...]
    - added: new detections since last callback
    - removed: detections that disappeared since last callback
    - frame: RGB numpy array (only if with_frame=True), else None
    """
    pp.pretty_print_change(detections, added, removed)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    det = TargetFinder()
    det.set_callback(on_change, with_frame=False, diff_iou=0.5)
    det.start()

    print("TargetFinder started — press Ctrl+C to stop.")
    try:
        while True:
            time.sleep(0.2)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        det.stop()
        print("Stopped.")
```

#### Save one annotated frame + crops

```python
import time
from pathlib import Path
from target_finder_toolkit.targetfinder import TargetFinder
from target_finder_toolkit import postprocess as pp

# global flag to ensure we only save once
_saved_once = False

def on_change(detections, added, removed, frame):
    """
    Save a single annotated frame and crops (first time we get detections+frame).
    """
    global _saved_once
    if _saved_once:
        return
    if frame is None or not detections:
        return

    out_dir = Path("out")
    out_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

    # Save annotated frame
    annot_path = out_dir / "annotated.png"
    pp.save_annotated(annot_path, frame, detections)

    # Extract and save crops
    crops = pp.extract_crops(frame, detections)
    crop_paths = pp.save_crops(out_dir / "crops", crops, prefix="crop", ext=".png")

    print(f"Saved annotated frame: {annot_path}")
    print(f"Saved {len(crop_paths)} crops under: {out_dir/'crops'}")

    _saved_once = True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    det = TargetFinder()
    # with_frame=True is required to receive the RGB frame in the callback
    det.set_callback(on_change, with_frame=True, diff_iou=0.5)
    det.start()

    print("TargetFinder started — will save once when detections are available. Ctrl+C to stop.")
    try:
        while True:
            time.sleep(0.2)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        det.stop()
        print("Stopped.")

```

#### Detect on a static image

```python
from target_finder_toolkit.targetfinder import TargetFinder

if __name__ == "__main__":
    image_path = "screenshot.png"  # change this to your image

    det = TargetFinder()
    detections = det.detect_image(
        image_path,
        save_annotated=True,   # creates e.g. screenshot_annotated.png
        save_json=True         # creates e.g. screenshot_detections.json
    )
```

### Ambiguity-triggered Bubble Gaze Lens prototype

`bubblegazelens` launches a single-monitor, mouse-proxy prototype. After a
stable 200 ms fixation near multiple plausible controls, it opens a fixed
sidecar lens using the detector's clean frame and stable target IDs.

The prototype is **dry-run only**: Enter logs the highlighted target, Escape
closes the lens, and `q` quits. It contains no operating-system click path.

```powershell
bubblegazelens --log artifacts/lens-events.jsonl
```

For a tracker-neutral gaze feed, send newline-free JSON datagrams containing
primary-screen logical pixels to localhost and select the UDP source:

```powershell
bubblegazelens --pointer udp --udp-port 4242 `
  --log artifacts/gaze-events.jsonl
```

```json
{"t_ms": 1234.5, "x": 812.2, "y": 498.1, "valid": true, "screen": "primary"}
```

The adapter binds only to `127.0.0.1`. It rejects normalized coordinates,
non-primary screens, malformed samples, and backward source timestamps. Tracker
timestamps and packet-health fields are logged as diagnostics; local monotonic
receipt time drives the interaction state. A visible status badge reports
tracking validity, and loss of valid samples closes an open lens safely.
Event logs also include the fixation-center offset from the current Bubble
winner as a selection diagnostic.

Gate B's three comparison conditions are available as
`--mode bubble|forced-lens|auto-lens`. The forced condition still requires a
stable fixation near at least two plausible targets; it ignores only the
nearest-target dominance threshold. JSONL replay traces use the same logical
pixel fields and can be run with `--pointer replay --replay-file PATH`.

Run the deterministic core, replay, and offscreen rendering checks with:

```powershell
python -m pytest -q
python tools/replay_lens.py `
  --scenarios tests/fixtures/lens `
  --report artifacts/replay-report.json `
  --contact-sheet artifacts/contact-sheet.png
python tools/evaluate_synthetic_ambiguity.py `
  --seeds 100 `
  --report artifacts/synthetic-evaluation.json
```

The passing zero-bias selection-ambiguity gate and trigger rationale are
recorded in `docs/synthetic-evaluation.md`.
The real-gaze comparison procedure is in `docs/human-gate-b.md`.

### Semantic Pointing

After installation, `semanticpointing` runs the Semantic Pointing interaction technique.

#### Available options:

> **Note:** The models are automatically loaded by the toolkit. They are also available on Hugging Face: [ab-dev26/targetfinder](https://huggingface.co/ab-dev26/targetfinder).

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--model` | Select one of our trained YOLO26 models. A higher input resolution or a larger model size provides better performance, especially for small widgets, but increases inference time. Available models: `yolo26[n\|s\|m]-[640\|1280\|1920]` (default = `yolo26n-640`). You can also supply your own model by passing the path to your `.pt` weights file. |
| `--change-thresh` | Screen change detection threshold. A higher value makes detection less sensitive to small variations. (`default = 100`). |
| `--capture-interval` | Time between screen captures in seconds. Lower values = higher frequency but more CPU/GPU usage. (`default = 1/30 ≈ 0.033s`). |
| `--confidence` | Minimum YOLO confidence required to keep a detection. (`[0.0–1.0], default = 0.4`). |
| `--iou` | IoU threshold for non-max suppression (controls overlap merging). (`[0.0–1.0], default = 0.3`). |
| `--display` *(semanticpointing only)* | Show visual feedback (motor vs visual space). |
| `--disable-accel` *(semanticpointing only)* | Disable system mouse acceleration. |

Example:
```bash
bubblecursor \
  --change-thresh 100 \
  --capture-interval 0.033 \
  --confidence 0.4 \
  --iou 0.3
```
